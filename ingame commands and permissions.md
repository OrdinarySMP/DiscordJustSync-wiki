# Ingame commands and permissions

There are 3 ingame commands available:
- `/discord reload`: reloads config without the need of restarting your server
- `/discord unlink`: unlinks you (and your alt)
- `/discord unlink <player>`: unlinks player (and their alt)

Their usage is restricted. Per default only the command to unlink yourself is unrestricted and accessible to non-op players.

Using luckperms you can edit the permissions. Their respective tags are `justsync.reload`, `justsync.unlink` and `justsync.unlink.other`.
