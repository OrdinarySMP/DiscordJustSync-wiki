# Vanish Integration

Players vanished with the [Vanish Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanish) are not given away by:
- updating the playercount to exclude vanished players
- hide vanished players in the /list command
- not showing disconnect messages when disconnecting while being vanished
- not showing join messages when joining while being vanished

The integration is turned on by default.
