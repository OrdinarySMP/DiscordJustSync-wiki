# Kick Messages

Kick messages are displayed when a player is actively kicked by the mod or when they can't join the server due to various reasons, such as being unlinked, timed out, etc. (see [Linking](Linking))

Placeholders for all messages are shown in the config.

### These messages can be edited:
- `kickMessages.kickMissingRoles`: Displayed when required roles are not fulfilled
- `kickMessages.kickLinkCode`: Shown when a member is not linked (includes the link code)
- `kickMessages.kickUnlinked`: Appears when a member is kicked due to unlinking
- `kickMessages.kickTimedOut`: Shown when members can't join due to a Discord timeout
- `kickMessages.kickOnTimeOut`: Displayed when members are kicked due to a Discord timeout
- `kickMessage.kickOnLeave`: Appears when an account is kicked because their associated Discord account left the server
